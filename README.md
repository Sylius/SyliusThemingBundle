About SyliusThemingBundle...
=================================

This bundle is part of **Sylius e-commerce system**.
Prototype version of bundle that add theming feature to any Symfony2 application.
You can manage themes through a simple and customizable web interface.
There are two theme resolvers built in, first one is static, that means the theme is activated only by admin in backend.
The second is dynamic, that means the user can change the theme anytime they want.
It is something like Styles in phpBB. **Docs are on their way...**
Stay tuned and [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/pjedrzejewski) for updates.

**Note!**
This bundle is **under heavy developement, it is not stable**.
Some stuff was inspired by the [nice LiipThemeBundle](http://github.com/liip/LiipThemeBundle).

About project "Sylius".
-----------------------

Sylius is meant to be a e-commerce system build on Symfony2 and by its community.
The goal is to create a end-user application that will be developer friendly.
Most of parts are fully functional and are powering 2 online shops that run in production.
The work is focused on the bundles like PluginsBundle and ThemingBundle.
More bundles are one their way to github. Stay tuned.

**Please note!** I know that many of this bundles are far from being perfect.
I just want to share my work with others and also learn something new.
